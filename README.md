<i>APPROXIMATION OF THE LEVY-DRIVEN STOCHASTIC HEAT EQUATION ON THE SPHERE</i>

It allows simulating sample paths of Lèvy random field and stochastic heat equation in time using Spectral methods in space and Euler-Maruyama in time.
Further, it contains functions for computing the convergence rate of the methods either direct or with Monte-Carlo simulations.
The script are in MATLAB and they generate plots (or videos) with the mentioned results.
